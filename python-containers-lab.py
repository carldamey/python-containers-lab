# Exercise 1

# Create a list named students containing some student names (strings).
# Print out the second student’s name.
# Print out the last student’s name.

students = ["Abay", "Caitlin", "Carl", "Kylie", "Leah", "Matt", "Morgan", "Nathan", "Selam", "Skye", "William"]
print(students[1])
print(students[-1])

# Exercise 2

# Create a tuple named foods containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the students list.
# Use a for loop to print out the string “[food goes here] is a good food”.

foods = ("Pizza", "Spaghetti", "Chicken", "Ice Cream", "Apple", "Burger", "Fries", "Eggs", "Broccoli", "Pork", "Banana")
for food in foods:
  print(f"{food} is a good food.")

# Exercise 3

# Using a for loop, print just the last two food strings from foods.

# Hint: Use the slice operator to select the last two foods



# Exercise 4

# Create a dictionary named home_town containing the keys of city, state and population.
# Print a string with this format:
# “I was born in city, state - population of population”



# Exercise 5

# Iterate over the key: value pairs in home_town and print a string for each item, for example:
# “city = Arcadia”
# “state = California”
# “population = 58000”



# Exercise 6

# Create an empty list named cohort.
# Using a for loop to iterate over the students list.
# Hint: Use the enumerate function to provide both the index & student

# Within the for loop, add a dictionary to the cohort list that combines the student’s name and the food in the foods list at the same index. Each dictionary will have this shape:

#   {
#     'student': 'Tina',
#     'fav_food': 'Cheeseburger'
#   }
# Iterate over the cohort list, printing out each item (it’s not necessary to format the dictionaries).



# Exercise 7

# Using the list of students and a list comprehension, assign to a variable named awesome_students a new list containing strings similar to this:
# ["Tina is awesome!", "Fred is awesome!", "Wilma is awesome!"]
# Iterate over the awesome_students list, printing out each string.



# Exercise 8

# Use a for loop to iterate over a list comprehension that filters the foods tuple to only include food strings that contains the letter a.
# Within the for loop, print each food string.
